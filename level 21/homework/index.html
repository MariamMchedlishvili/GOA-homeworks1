                <h3>Ancient China</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The Chinese competitive game cuju is an early type of ball game where feet were used, in some aspects resembling modern association football. 
                    It was possibly played around the Han dynasty and early Qin dynasty, based on an attestation in a military manual from around the second to 
                    third centuries BC.In one version, gameplay consisted of players passing the ball between teammates without allowing it to touch
                    the ground (much like keepie uppie). In its competitive version, two teams had to pass the ball without it falling, before kicking the ball 
                    through a circular hole placed in the middle of the pitch. Unlike association football, the two teams did not interact with each other but 
                    instead stayed on opposite sides of the pitch. The Japanese version of cuju is kemari (蹴鞠), and was developed during the Asuka period.
                    This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto from about 600 AD. 
                    In kemari, several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground.</p>

                <h3>Ancient Greece and Rome</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. 
                    The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as "ἐπίσκυρος" (Episkyros) or "φαινίνδα" 
                    (phaininda), which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement 
                    of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215 AD). These games appear to have resembled rugby football. The Roman politician Cicero 
                    (106–43 BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop.
                     Roman ball games already knew the air-filled ball, the follis. Episkyros is described as an early form of football by FIFA.</p>

                Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football 
                generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used.
