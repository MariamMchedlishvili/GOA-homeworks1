            <p>
                I am Mariami and I study in Goal Oriented Academy. when school was about to finish I decided, I didn't want to waste time scrolling on social
                medias. So i started to look for academys where they tought programming. I found GOA and here I am. This academy really helps you to become 
                better version of you, this applies to programming or personal development.
