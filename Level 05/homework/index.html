<h1>My Favorite Character</h1>
<h2>The Little Prince</h2>
<P>My favorite charachter is little prince. The little prince is my favorit book, it is written by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. 
    this book is about golden haired boy from a distant asteroid begins his
    journey, where he explores themes of love, loss, the essence of human connection and values. also the charachter's connection with narrator forms
    good mood and it gives you the desire to read again and again. little boy's questions make readers to think about life. it is blend of wisdom and 
    childlike wonder.
    In my opinion, everyone should read this book, not only children, adults too.
