My name is Mariami and I'm 16 years old. I live in tbilisi. I go to school and at the same time I attend the programming academy GOA. My school has provided a solid foundation in various subjects, but it was my interest in technology that led me to explore programming more deeply. balancing school and the programming academy has been challenging, but I have been trying to learn time management. I think this is also a good experience that will help me to grow more disciplined.
